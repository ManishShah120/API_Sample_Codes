# Basic High level Sample Codes for the API's

> __Note__: If any other sample code for different models is required to demonstrate,  
will be added to this repo.

*PS*: I haven't tested the above code, this is just an overview of  
how we can aciehve all other tasks by applying all the required logic, with different genericviews,  
classes, and other custom DRF mixins from `openwisp-users` module.
